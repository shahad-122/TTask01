# 🎨 Nada's Personal Website

This is my personal portfolio website created as part of **Week 2 – Task 1** of the Smart Methods Internship program.

It serves as a simple yet professional introduction to who I am, the skills I’ve learned, and the projects I’ve worked on.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m Nada, a 2024 graduate from the Faculty of Computer and Information Science.

I recently completed a 9-month track in **Open Source Application Development** at the **Information Technology Institute (ITI)**, where I gained practical experience in full-stack web development using open-source technologies.

I’m passionate about software development, especially backend work, and I enjoy building real-world applications.
